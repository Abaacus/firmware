# wfe-os Buildroot Project

# Getting Started:

## Dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y git build-essential wget cpio unzip rsync bc libncurses5-dev screen
```

## Initialization

Initialize the repository with:
```
./init.sh
```

This is will:
* Download Buildroot
* Patch Buildroot with any out-of-tree configuration that may be
required.
* Then set the repo folder as the out-of-tree build folder. 
This keeps all of the build information outside of the Buildroot
folder, basically just using the Buildroot repository as a source of
configuration. This allows versions of Buildroot to be interchanged 
relatively easily if necessary.

## Building

Kick off a build with:
```
make
```

## Configuration

A ncurses-based configuration GUI can be run using the following:
```
make menuconfig
```

This will save your configuration to a temporary file called
`.config`. If you wish to save this configuration back to the
currently active defconfig (current, we use
`config/beaglebone_wfe_deconfig`), you can use the following command:
```
make savedefconfig
```
