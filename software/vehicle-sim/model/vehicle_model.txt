# High Level: Sum of X forces
## Ft = Torque force on rear tires
## Ff = friction force per tire
## Fd = drag force, negligible for now
ΣFx m*a_x = 2*Ft - 4*Ff - Fd

## d_t is diameter of tire
## T is torque
## 2 Axles assume distributed equally
Ft = T/(d_t/2)/2

# High Level: Sum of Y forces
## Take 0 y acceleration for first principles analysis
## Fn normal force per tire
## Fg gravity force per tire
ΣFy = m*a_y = 4*Fn - 4*Fg
